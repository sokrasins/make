# CheepCheep

A C-based rewrite of the BeepBeep firmware

## Building

Install the ESP IDF - [ESP-IDF: Get Started](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32s3/get-started/index.html). When installing the idf, you need:

- ESP-IDF v5.5
- When running `install.sh`, make sure you install support for the `esp32c3` (or all targets).

Navigate to this directory. To build, run `idf.py all` to build the project.
